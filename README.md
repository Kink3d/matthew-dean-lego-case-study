# Matthew Dean - Lego Case Study

For this assignment I wanted to play with a puzzle mechanic that rewarded curiosity, problem solving, and pattern recognition. Since I had very little time I decided to do something grid based, to simplify movement and AI logic (and importantly avoid wasting time tuning physics!). I took inspiration from Lara Croft GO by Square Enix, and built some simple movement puzzle mechanics that allowed me to experiment with multiple smaller chunks of gameplay.

I also decided that I needed a player retention mechanic so I went with tracking the amount of player moves then challenging the player to improve their score, attempting to do each puzzle with the minimum possible moves. With the right feedback this would (hopefully) engage the player to spend more time in the app.

## Running the app
The app can bee ran locally as per a usual Vite project, or you can use the deployed version I have prepared.

### Deployed
- Open `bit.ly/4mfJqu8` in a web browser (or on your phone!)

### Local
- Extract this ZIP file
- Open the directory in Terminal/CMD
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
